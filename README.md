# **SecAPI: Secure Your API Keys Before They Leak**

## **Overview**
SecAPI is a Python-based tool designed to help developers securely manage and store API keys, credentials, and sensitive information. It offers automated key rotation, end-to-end encryption, and role-based access control to ensure that your API keys remain safe and protected against unauthorized access. Whether you're working on a personal project, a startup, or managing large-scale enterprise-level applications, secapi provides a straightforward and secure solution for API key management.

## **Features**
- **Secure API Key Management**: Safeguard your keys with encryption both at rest and in transit.
- **Automated Key Rotation**: Automatically rotate your API keys to minimize exposure risks.
- **Easy CLI Interface**: Manage your keys with simple commands for checking, rotating, listing, and deleting keys.
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates easily with your development environment, supporting Python-based applications (**for now**).
- **AI-Powered Security**: secapi uses machine learning algorithms to detect potential vulnerabilities and recommend security enhancements.
- **Comprehensive Auditing**: Keep track of all key access events for full transparency and compliance.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.6 or later
- pip (Python package manager)

### **Installation via pip**
To install secapi as a Python package, simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install secapi
```

This will install the latest version of secapi and its dependencies.

## **Usage**

### **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
secapi is operated through a command-line interface (CLI). After installing, you can run the tool by typing `sentinel` followed by the desired command.

To get started, you can check the available commands:

```bash
secapi -h
```

### **Commands**

1. **`check <dir>`**:
   - Scans the given directory for any unprotected API keys or sensitive data.
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     secapi check /path/to/project
     ```

2. **`list`**:
   - Lists all stored API keys in your secapi vault.
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     secapi list
     ```

3. **`delete <key_name>`**:
   - Deletes a specific API key from the vault.
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     secapi delete my-api-key
     ```

4. **`rotate <key_name>`**:
   - Rotates the specified API key and updates it in the vault.
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     secapi rotate my-api-key
     ```

5. **`load <key_name>`**:
   - Loads a specific API key for use in the application.
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash
     secapi load my-api-key
     ```

### **Help Command**
For any command, you can get help and see options by running:

```bash
secapi <command> -h
```

---

## **Configuration**

To configure secapi, simply create a configuration file called `secapi_config.yaml` in your project directory. Here, you can define security settings, like the frequency of key rotation, and specify encryption options.

**Example `secapi_config.yaml`:**

```yaml
security:
  auto_rotate_keys: true
  rotate_interval_days: 30
  encryption_key: YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Key Rotation**: secapi automatically rotates your API keys to ensure they are always up-to-date and secure. When you use the `rotate` command, it generates a new key, replaces the old one, and securely updates it in the system.
2. **Encryption**: secapi uses industry-standard encryption to protect stored keys. It ensures that keys are never exposed in plaintext, both in storage and during transmission.
3. **AI-Powered Scanning**: secapi scans your project directories for exposed keys and sensitive data, making it easier to spot potential vulnerabilities.
4. **Auditing**: secapi logs all actions performed on your keys, such as creation, modification, deletion, and access, ensuring compliance and traceability.
